# Weather Forecast using Logistic Regression Classifier
‘Weather Forecast using Logistic Regression Classifier’ is intended to predict the precipitation type of the weather, whether it would be rain or snow. The model processed and analyzed weather history data to determine the precipitation type. As the evaluation, the model achieves 99.8% accuracy using Logistic Regression Classifier to classify the weather into two classes, Rain or Snow.
